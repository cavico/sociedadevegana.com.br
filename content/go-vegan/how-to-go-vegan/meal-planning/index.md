Nutritional planning is important for everyone, particularly when you’re making dietary changes. So, how can you transition to a healthy vegan diet that works for you?

It’s worth setting aside a bit of time for research. Our [nutrition overview](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrition-overview) is a great starting point. You can also use our free [VNutrition app](https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/introducing-vnutrition) to compare your diet to healthy eating guidance. As well as learning about balancing food groups, make sure that you’ve got some knowledge of fortified foods and supplementation at your fingertips. This will give you a solid framework for planning your vegan diet.

Once you’ve got your head around replacing animal products with alternative sources of nutrition, it’s time for our favourite bit – glorious food! Use our [Vegan and Thriving recipes](https://www.vegansociety.com/take-action/campaigns/vegan-thriving/vegan-thriving-recipes) to help you plan balanced and tasty meals.
