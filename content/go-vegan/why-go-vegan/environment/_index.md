## How your diet could change the world

While the world’s population has doubled since the 1960s, world meat production [has quadrupled](http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/ap106e/ap106e.pdf). In certain areas, livestock production has increased massively; there are now [4 and a half times](http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/rankings/commodities_by_regions/E) as many tonnes of pig produced in 2013 compared to 1961, while world chicken production has increased by nearly [13 times](http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/rankings/commodities_by_regions/E).

These harrowing numbers are growing. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations predicts that by 2050 world meat production will have almost [doubled](http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/ap106e/ap106e.pdf), as the Western taste for meat, eggs and dairy products continues to grow (along with our waistlines).

This trend will continue to contribute to global warming, widespread pollution, deforestation, land degradation, water scarcity and species extinction. More animals mean more crops are needed to feed them: the planet cannot feed both increasing human and farmed animal populations, especially when there will be between [2-4 billion](http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/panel_population.htm) more human mouths to feed by 2050.

If we are trying to reduce our car use, limit the amount of water we waste, become more ‘energy-efficient’ and generally lessen our environmental impact, we must also examine the most important factor of our personal ecological footprint: [what we eat](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1169-1).
