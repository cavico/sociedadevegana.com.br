## All the nutrients without the animal products

Many people grow up thinking that animal products like meat and milk are essential parts of a healthy diet. However, well-planned vegan diets follow healthy eating guidelines, and contain all the nutrients that our bodies need. Both the [British Dietetic Association](https://www.vegansociety.com/society/whos-involved/partners/british-dietetic-association) and the [American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx) recognise that they are suitable for every age and stage of life.

### An opportunity to eat better

Going vegan is a great opportunity to learn more about nutrition and cooking, and improve your diet. You won't be consuming saturated fat from meat, milk and eggs, and you'll be avoiding processed meat, which the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/en/) has classified as a cause of cancer. Getting your nutrients from plant foods allows more room in your diet for health-promoting options. If you make smart choices, a vegan diet can be a really healthy way of eating. Get the most out of yours by limiting salt and eating plenty of whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetables. These foods are packed full of beneficial fibre, vitamins and minerals.

### Excellent long-term health

Some research has linked vegan diets with lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and lower rates of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. You can eat a totally plant-based diet that supports excellent health, whilst helping animals and protecting the planet.
