## Going vegan has never been easier than with VeGuide by The Vegan Society.

The Vegan Society is the first vegan charity in the world and for over 70 years, we have been helping people go and stay vegan.  Now we have taken those decades of experience to create an easy-to-use app that will guide you through your vegan journey.

Over 30 days, we will cover the basics of transitioning to a vegan lifestyle with our short, daily videos.  The videos are presented by [Mic the Vegan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGJq0eQZoFSwgcqgxIE9MHw), [Rae Likes Froot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYcp7V70Polb7Fdu0IM0wqw) and [Jay Brave](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCprJ949iAL0tnudsS5ex4LQ), who will act as your personal vegan guides, exploring the most common stumbling blocks to going vegan and giving you the tools to overcome them.

Think you will never be able to give up cheese? Do you struggle with finding vegan products? Are you just undecided if veganism really is the right choice for you? We’ll help you with all of this and so much more!

As you progress through your journey, watch your sunflower grow and blossom in the “My Progress” section of the app. Check in for the full 30 days and at the end of the journey, you should be ready to become a fully-fledged vegan!
