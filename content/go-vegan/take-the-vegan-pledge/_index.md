## Common questions

Q: Do I need to be vegan to take the Pledge?

A: The pledge is intended for people who aren’t vegan but are curious about veganism; or those who may have attempted it before and wish to try again in a more determined manner. However, it is also useful for new vegans just learning the ropes, and we encourage anyone who needs the extra advice and support to take it. If you’re already a vegan why not head over to our '[Take action](https://www.vegansociety.com/take-action)' pages to discover other ways to become involved.

Q: I ate cake that had dairy in it – do I have to start at the beginning again?

A: Not at all – sometimes even the most careful vegans get tripped up by something. We all do the best we can and by making a conscious decision to being vegan for a month you have shown that you are already thinking differently about your choices.

Q: I have a specific question – where can I get help?

A: Our '[Resources](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources)' section is full of lifestyle information, nutrition advice, recipes and answers to frequently asked questions. Yet if you feel you have a question that only a human can answer, then you can contact us at [info@vegansociety.com](mailto:info@vegansociety.com) or link up with others through channels like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheVeganSociety) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheVeganSociety) where you'll discover many friendly people happy to help.

We've been running the vegan pledge for many years. Over this time we've received countless emails from people saying that it was so much easier than they expected. A great deal of them say they wish they'd tried the lifestyle years ago, as they're so much happier, healthier and more content. For a lot of us, it's the best decision we ever make.

> "Thank you for your support during my 30 day pledge. Seeing the emails every morning always reminded me to stay on track. The kids are now not arguing and debating my decision on a daily basis so it is easier. I do see my family changing by watching my example over the months to come." - Lynda Lambert, 01/12/15
